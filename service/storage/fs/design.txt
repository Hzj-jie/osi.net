
each directory or file is called an inode in the system.
files and directories are equal, i.e. a directory can have properties, while a file can have sub files.
so the 'file' in the following paragraph does not mean an inode, instead it means the key-value pair in the istrkeyvt.
an inode is the set of properties and sub inodes,
under a certain inode, there are two files $. and $
$. contains a list of sub inodes
$ contains a list of properties
so the name of an inode does not allow to have $, but since / is using as path separator, / is not allowed to be in the inode name.
also $ and / are not allowed in property name.
say when trying to open an inode /foo/bar, the system will try to find /foo/bar/$. and /foo/bar/$
in /foo/bar/$., say, it contains a, b [in chunk format], which means there are two inodes /foo/bar/a and /foo/bar/b
in /foo/bar/$, say, it contains text, blob [in chunk format], which means there are two properites, named as text and blob, the keys are /foo/bar/text and /foo/bar/blob.
so the key /foo/bar/a is the key of property a of /foo/bar, while it does not mean an inode named as /foo/bar/a.
